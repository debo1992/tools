When thermal radiation (infrared light) from a scene enters the system, a lens focuses the incoming IR energy onto the array of micro-oxide-mirrors. Each mirror is either coated with an IR-absorbing layer or is made of a material that can directly absorb IR.

The absorbed IR radiation heats up the micro-mirror. As the mirror warms, the underlying actuator expands, causing a tiny deflection (displacement or tilt) of the mirror.

This deflection is measured optically:

A visible probe light source (such as an LED) shines onto the mirror array from below. The mirrors reflect this probe light onto a CMOS sensor.

As each mirror tilts by a slightly different angle (depending on how much IR it absorbed), the reflection shifts.

The CMOS sensor records these shifts, translating them into pixel intensity values.

By combining the responses of all the mirrors in the array, the system reconstructs a thermal image showing which parts of the scene are hotter or cooler.
